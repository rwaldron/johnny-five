## Setup and Assemble Arduino

- Download Arduino IDE
  - [OSX](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-macosx.zip)
  - [Linux 32 bit](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-linux.tgz)
  - [Linux 64 bit](http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-1.0-linux64.tgz)
  - Windows support coming soon.
- Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB
- Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
- Click the "Upload" button.

If the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE.


**Attention** There is a known issue in where the Firmata protocol layer has issues freeing itself on the serial line which results in the program hanging in when it tries to connect. For now, the only way to get around the issue is to send a SIGINT ` ^C ` to kill the hanging program and simply run it again.

    board = new five.Board();

board.on("ready", function() {

  // Create an Led on pin 13 and strobe it on/off
  // Optionall set the speed; defaults to 100ms
  (new five.Led(13)).strobe();

});
```

**Johnny-Five is an Open Source, Firmata Protocol based, IoT and Robotics programming framework, developed at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com). Johnny-Five programs can be written for Arduino (all models), Electric Imp, Beagle Bone, Intel Galileo & Edison, Linino One, Pinoccio, pcDuino3, Raspberry Pi, Particle/Spark Core & Photon, Tessel 2, TI Launchpad and more!**

Johnny-Five has grown from a passion project into a tool for inspiring learning and creativity for people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all across the world. 

Just interested in learning and building awesome things? You might want to start with the official [Johnny-Five website](http://johnny-five.io). The website combines content from this repo, the wiki, tutorials from the Bocoup blog and several third-party websites into a single, easily-discoverable source:

* If you want to find the API documentation, [that’s right here](http://johnny-five.io/api/).
* Need to figure out what platform to use for a project? We put that stuff [here](http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/).
* Need inspiration for your next NodeBot? Check out the [examples](http://johnny-five.io/examples/).
* Want to stay up-to-date with projects in the community? [Check this out](http://johnny-five.io/articles/).
* Need NodeBots community or Johnny-Five project updates and announcements? [This](http://johnny-five.io/news/) is what you’re looking for.


Johnny-Five does not attempt to provide "all the things", but instead focuses on delivering robust, reality tested, highly composable APIs that behave consistently across all supported hardware platforms. Johnny-Five wants to be a baseline control kit for hardware projects, allowing you the freedom to build, grow and experiment with diverse JavaScript libraries of your own choice. Johnny-Five couples comfortably with:

- Popular application libraries such as [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).
- Fellow hardware projects like [ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone), [Aerogel](https://github.com/ceejbot/aerogel) and [Spheron](https://github.com/alchemycs/spheron)
- Bluetooth game controllers like [XBox Controller](https://github.com/andrew/node-xbox-controller) and [DualShock](https://github.com/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller)
- IoT frameworks, such as [Octoblu](http://www.octoblu.com/)

...And that's only a few of the many explorable possibilities.

## Hello Johnny

The ubiquitous "Hello World" program of the microcontroller and SoC world is "blink an LED". The following code demonstrates how this is done using the Johnny-Five framework.

```javascript
var five = require("johnny-five");
var board = new five.Board();

board.on("ready", function() {
  // Create an Led on pin 13
  var led = new five.Led(13);
  // Blink every half second
  led.blink(500); 
});
```

<img src="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/raw/master/assets/led-blink.gif">

> Note: Node will crash if you try to run johnny-five in the node REPL, but board instances will create their own contextual REPL. Put your script in a file.


## Supported Hardware

Johnny-Five has been tested on a variety of Arduino-compatible [Boards](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Board).

For non-Arduino based projects, a number of platform-specific [IO Plugins](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/IO-Plugins) are available. IO Plugins allow Johnny-Five code to communicate with any non-Arduino based hardware in whatever language that platforms speaks!

## Documentation

Documentation for the Johnny-Five API can be found [here](http://johnny-five.io/api/) and [example programs here](http://johnny-five.io/examples/).

For step-by-step examples, including an electronics primer, check out [Arduino Experimenter's Guide for NodeJS](http://node-ardx.org/) by [@AnnaGerber](https://twitter.com/AnnaGerber)

Here is a list of [prerequisites](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#prerequisites) for Linux, OSX or Windows.

Check out the [bluetooth guide](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/JY-MCU-Bluetooth-Serial-Port-Module-Notes) if you want to remotely control your robot.

## Setup and Assemble Arduino

- Recommended Starting Kit: [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001)
- Download [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB
- Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmataPlus
    + StandardFirmataPlus is available in Firmata v2.5.0 or greater
- Click the "Upload" button.

If the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE.

For non-Arduino projects, each IO Plugin's repo will provide its own platform specific setup instructions.


## Hey you, here's Johnny!

#### Source Code:

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five.git && cd johnny-five

npm install
```

#### npm package:

Install the module with:

```bash
npm install johnny-five
```


## Example Programs

To get you up and running quickly, we provide a variety of examples for using each Johnny-Five component. One thing we’re especially excited about is the extensive collection of [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) diagrams you’ll find throughout the site. A huge part of doing any Johnny-Five project is handling the actual hardware, and we’ve included these as part of the documentation because we realised that instructions on how to write code to control a servo are insufficient without instructions on how to connect a servo!

To interactively navigate the examples, visit the [Johnny-Five examples](http://johnny-five.io/examples/) page on the official website. If you want to link directly to the examples in this repo, you can use one of the following links.

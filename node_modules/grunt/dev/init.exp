## Project Creation Transcript

\"init:$template\" template, this session transcript was added afterwards. The
text after the `$` are the commands that were executed, and everything else is
program output. If you want to see the repository exactly as it was created by
grunt, view \[the previous commit\]\[prev\].' > README.md\r"
